Modify Flow 4 - Adaptive RAG - from the Tutorial 5 notebook to have 1 more tool in
the Query Analysis routing. Experiment and demonstrate that the routing occurs to
your chosen tool. (Tools reference is here)
The output should run in the notebook for this graph flow only, that's the main task,
but you can also add more tools and experiment.
